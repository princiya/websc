## Workshop abstract
The web today is a growing universe. Over the years, web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful web experiences. One such feature is WebRTC, which provides browsers and mobile applications with Real Time Communication (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs.

In this hands-on workshop you will learn to build applications to support real time communication on the web. You will build an app to get video and take snapshots with your webcam and share them peer-to-peer via WebRTC. Along the way, you'll learn how to use the core WebRTC APIs and set up a messaging server using Node.

## Blog

[Here](https://princiya777.wordpress.com/category/websc/) is a blog post series for this workshop. While it is possible to do real time communication on the browser with only few lines of JavaScript code, WebRTC is quite complicated with different set of browser APIs and network protocols. Please make some time to do a background reading on this topic via my blog in order to get a good hands-on coding experience during the workshop.
